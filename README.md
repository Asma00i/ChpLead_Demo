# **Chplead_Demo Project**

**_Project Overview_**

This project is designed to automate API functional and performance tests using RestAssured, JMeter, and Gatling. It incorporates advanced error handling, retry mechanisms, and integration with reporting tools such as Allure and Extent Reports.

**_Features_**

API Functional Testing

Automated functional tests using RestAssured and TestNG.

Custom error handling and retry logic.

Performance Testing using JMeter

Simulates high-concurrency scenarios to validate API scalability and response times.

Mocked API Testing

Mock external services using WireMock.

Error Handling

Custom error handlers for different failure modes.

Retry logic for transient network issues and server errors.

Reporting

Integrated with Allure and Extent Reports for generating detailed test execution reports.

**_Known Issues:_**
Extent report doesn't include all tests
JMeter File is not included however env setup done
